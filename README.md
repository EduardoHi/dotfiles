# Ah, the classic personal repo dotfiles

Is there anything of value for you here? I don't know.
But if you want, feel free to search, I have some really old scripts
that somehow ended up being useful, and other ones are oneshots.

Also I'm pretty sure I missed some dotfiles, but I'll know about them
when it's to late to fix the problem.

## stuff here:

- i3
  - i3blocks here too but not really used
- polybar
new bar for my i3
- ranger
ftw file explorer 10/10 would recommend
- x
because x
- vim
not really proud of this one but meh
- zathura
also meh but hey it's here so might aswell use it even though I don't remember what that thing configuration did.
